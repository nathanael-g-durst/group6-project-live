## Overview
The KrakenR Shiny app is an interactive application designed to showcase the functionality of the KrakenR package, providing users with near real-time insights into cryptocurrency markets. This vignette walks through the user interface elements, the underlying logic, and the challenges faced during development, with a focus on efficiency and innovative solutions.

## Near Real-Time Data Management

### Challenges and Solutions
The app integrates live data from Kraken’s API, presenting challenges such as API rate limits, data freshness, and responsiveness. To overcome these challenges:

- **Rate Limiting**: A custom `rate_limited_call` function was implemented to ensure API calls comply with Kraken’s restrictions while maintaining seamless updates.
- **Reactive Caching**: Data such as trading pairs and tickers is cached for specific durations (e.g., 24 hours for trading pairs, 5 seconds for tickers) to minimize redundant API calls.
- **Granular Reactivity**: Reactive values and observers ensure that only relevant components are updated when data changes, reducing computational overhead.

## User Interface Elements

### Dashboard
The dashboard is the central hub of the app, providing an overview of the selected trading pair’s key metrics and visualizations.

#### Dynamic Trading Pair Selection
A dropdown menu allows users to select a trading pair dynamically. The dropdown options are fetched from the `getPairs` API endpoint and updated reactively. The selected pair triggers updates to all other components on the dashboard.

#### Main Information Header
The header displays:

- **Trading Pair Title**: Reactively updates based on the selected pair.
- **Last Price**: The latest ask price from the ticker data. A custom reactive function determines the box’s color, transitioning dynamically between green (price increase), red (price decrease), and gray (no change).
- **24-Hour Change**: Calculated from OHLC data, showing the percentage price change over the past 24 hours with a similar reactive color scheme.
- **24-Hour Volume**: The cumulative trading volume over the past 24 hours, displayed with the selected cryptocurrency symbol.
- **Price Alert System**: Allows users to set alerts for when the price **goes up** to a specified value, keeping them updated in real time.

##### Reactive Color Implementation
To implement dynamic colors:

1. A helper function, `get_color`, evaluates the current and previous values.
2. Colors are updated reactively using `renderValueBox`, ensuring real-time feedback on market trends.

### Market Chart
The market chart visualizes the selected trading pair’s price data, offering multiple chart types and statistical overlays.

#### Chart Types
Users can choose between candlestick, line, and area charts. The `plotly` package ensures interactivity and high-quality rendering.

#### Statistical Methods
Options include:

- **Moving Average**: A smoothed price trend using a rolling mean.
- **Bollinger Bands**: Visualizes volatility and potential price trends.
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: Highlights recent price changes more sensitively than a simple moving average.

The overlay data is computed reactively and added to the chart, ensuring that updates occur seamlessly without reloading the entire component.

### Bid/Ask Table
One of the most challenging components, the bid/ask table dynamically visualizes the order book with grouped data and a bar plot background.

#### Adaptive Interval Scaling
Price intervals are calculated dynamically using the `get_scaled_intervals` function, which adjusts based on the median price of the order book to ensure clarity regardless of the trading pair’s price range.

#### HTML Table with Bar Plot Background
To create the bar plot effect:

1. Each row’s background width is proportional to the cumulative quantity.
2. Custom HTML and inline CSS dynamically adjust the background size and color for each row.
3. Data is grouped and aggregated to optimize rendering performance.

This feature required careful handling of CSS styling and reactive updates to ensure synchronization with real-time data changes.

### Last Trades Table
The last trades table provides a snapshot of recent transactions, including:

- Price
- Volume
- Order Type (buy/sell)
- Execution Type (market/limit)

#### Filtering and Refreshing
Users can filter trades by order and execution types. The table updates reactively upon user interaction or manual refresh, ensuring the displayed data is always relevant.

---

## News Tab
The news tab integrates with the CryptoPanic API to provide the latest cryptocurrency news. 

### Features

- **Dynamic News Cards**: Articles are displayed as interactive cards with publication date, title, and currency relevance.
- **Pagination**: Users can navigate through news articles using custom pagination controls.
- **Modal View**: Clicking a news card opens a modal displaying the article in an iframe. A fallback link ensures accessibility if the iframe fails to load.

### Data Management
News data is fetched periodically and deduplicated using `dplyr`, ensuring only new and unique articles are displayed. Reactive pagination adjusts dynamically based on the total number of articles and the selected page.

## AI Chat Assistant

The app integrates an **AI-powered GPT model** to answer user questions about cryptocurrency assets. Users can interact with the model by typing queries into the chat interface.

#### Key Features:

- Provides information about cryptocurrency assets.
- Ensures responses are generated dynamically using an external AI backend hosted on Render.
- Allows users to ask open-ended questions, enhancing the app's analytical capabilities.

> **Note**: The backend powering the AI model is separate from the package and the documents hosted are available in this repository within the `render-backend` folder.

## Conclusion
The KrakenR Shiny app demonstrates advanced R and Shiny techniques, integrating real-time data, interactive visualizations, and AI-powered analytics. Key innovations include:

- Dynamic and adaptive visualizations (e.g., bid/ask table with bar plot backgrounds).
- Efficient data management strategies to handle near real-time updates.
- A polished UI design that enhances usability and aesthetics.
- **Price Alert System** to notify users when prices go up to a specific threshold.
- **AI Chat Assistant** integration, enabling users to ask questions and receive insights about cryptocurrency assets.

By addressing complex challenges and ensuring computational efficiency, the app serves as a robust platform for cryptocurrency market analysis.
